        <h1><i>🌟<u> Who I Am</u></i></h1>
     <p><i>
     My name is Mohammad Rehan Alam, and I am a dedicated Student Developer<BR>
     with a growing interest in the world of technology. I have developed a strong<BR>
     foundation in<u> "HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python"</u>, which allows me to create<BR>
     structured, functional, and visually appealing web pages. My journey in the coding<BR>
     field began with a deep interest in technology and a curiosity to understand how<BR>
     digital systems work.<BR><BR><BR><BR>

     Over time, I have worked on several projects that helped me sharpen my skills<BR>
     including a <u>"Book Recommendation Chatbot"</u>, which enhanced my understanding<BR>
     of user interaction and intelligent system design. Experiences like these have<BR>
     strengthened my passion for development and motivated me to explore more<BR>
     advanced concepts.<BR><BR><BR><BR>

     In the future, I aspire to contribute to the field of Artificial Intelligence<BR>
     by building smart and interactive web pages that use AI to enhance user<BR>
     experience. I am committed to continuous learning, improving my technical<BR>
     abilities, and expanding my knowledge to keep pace with evolving technological<BR>
     trends.<BR><BR>
